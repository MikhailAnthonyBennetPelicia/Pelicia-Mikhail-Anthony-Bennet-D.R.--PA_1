### This is my submission for the first programming assignment for Introduction to Python

## The first section of this code is called "Alphabet Soup"
#### The instruction was to create a code which takes a string and sorts the letters in the string and returns the letters in alphabetical order. To do this, I first defined the function "alphabet_soup(word)". I then used the function sorted, which sorts the characters of the string into sorted list in alphabetical order. And finally, I used to function "''.join" to combine the sorted list back into a string.
